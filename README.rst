Introduction
---------------

InfoClass is a a library for the information-theoretic evaluation of classifiers on different kinds of data. 
The aim is to provide a suite of tools for evaluating classification tasks on arbitrary data, either using 
a given classifier, or using popular libraries for classifiers, such as sklearn. The project will also eventually
incorporate Tensorflow NN classifiers, as well as libraries for dynamically converting certain popular
filetypes, such as SVMLight, NifTi, Annotated Images, and other data.
